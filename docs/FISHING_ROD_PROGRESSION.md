# Rising Tides Fishing Rod Strange Titles

## Strange Quality Requirement

Only fishing rods with the **Strange** quality can track catches and progress through titles. When crafting a fishing rod, there is a **10% chance** it will receive the Strange quality. Non-strange rods function normally but cannot:

- Track total catches
- Gain titles
- Receive title bonuses

This makes Strange rods significantly more valuable and creates an exciting element of chance in the crafting process.
